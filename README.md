# Player FM Mobile App

A mobile demo for Player FM ..

## Getting Started

    gem install guard guard-haml guard-coffeescript guard-sass

I'm using [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) to auto-compile the HAML,
Coffee, and SASS. With LiveReload:

  * Check the "Compile LESS, Stylus ..." option.
  * **IMPORTANT:** You must check the "Enabled" option for HAML, in Compiler
    Settings. LiveReload doesn't enable it by default.
